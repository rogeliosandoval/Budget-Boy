Budget Boy is an online tool that helps you keep track of all of your finances to make sure you never go under budget. The dashboard allows you to list all of your incomes and expenses so you can see exactly what you're saving or losing per month.
<br>
<br>
A checklist is also included that allows you to mark off your expenses that you already paid for the month. This can help make sure you never miss another a payment again. It's also pretty cool to see how much you have to spend. B)
